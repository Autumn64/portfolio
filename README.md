Everything I have done related to coding at my university.

Although I have posted a few things in Python, HTML/CSS and JS here, I'm making this repository to upload everything I have done (and will do) on my programming classes at my university, because I think these codes might be a lil useful for beginners or people who need help with stuff for their own majors and projects.

I started this repository on 2023-05-21, 2 months away from finishing the 2nd semester of Computer Systems Engineering at UVM Hispano.
Also, many of the code provided here is in Spanish, sorry for that :/
