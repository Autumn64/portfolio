Everything I have done related to coding at my university.

Although I have posted a few things in Python, HTML/CSS and JS here, I'm making this repository to upload everything I have done (and will do) on my programming classes at my university, because I think these codes might be a lil useful for beginners or people who need help with stuff for their own majors and projects.

I started this repository on 2023-05-21, 2 months away from finishing the 2nd semester of Computer Systems Engineering at UVM Hispano.
Also, most of the code provided here is in Spanish, sorry for that :/

PD: Due to personal reasons the name in the files from the 2nd semester is different from the rest of the files, but actually it was the same person who made all of them.
